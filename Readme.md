- **Seasonal & Occasion-Driven Sales: Revenue significantly fluctuates across months, with peak performance during major festivals and special occasions.
- **Top Products Drive Majority Revenue: A small number of products contribute disproportionately to total revenue, indicating revenue concentration.
- **Geographic Revenue Concentration: A few cities account for the highest number of orders, while other regions show low penetration.
- **Customer Spending is Relatively High: Customers are willing to spend more per order, suggesting an opportunity for upselling and premium positioning.
